Issue Summary:
Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM on March 13, 2024 (UTC timezone).
Impact: The service experienced complete unavailability during this time, affecting 85% of users.
Users were unable to access their data, manipulate repositories, or perform any actions reliant on GitHub API integration.

Timeline:
10:00 AM: Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating a spike in error rates.
10:05 AM: Engineering team notified of the issue.
10:10 AM: Investigation commenced, focusing on potential backend database issues.
10:25 AM: Misleading assumption made that the database query optimization might be causing the problem.
10:40 AM: The issue escalated to senior backend engineers.
11:00 AM: Realization that the issue stemmed from GitHub API integration.
11:15 AM: Emergency communication sent to affected users about the ongoing outage.
11:30 AM: Issue resolved after implementing a workaround.

Root Cause: The issue originated from GitHub API rate limiting, causing our application to exceed the allowed threshold of requests per minute.
This led to requests being rejected by GitHub's servers, resulting in service unavailability.

Resolution: To mitigate the issue, we implemented caching mechanisms to reduce the frequency of API calls and spread requests evenly over time.
Additionally, we adjusted the application's request handling logic to handle rate-limiting errors more gracefully, providing informative messages to users during such situations.

Improvements/Fixes:
  - Implement more robust error handling mechanisms to handle API rate-limiting scenarios.
  - Enhance monitoring capabilities to proactively detect and alert on potential API rate-limiting issues.
  - Explore options for scaling up API request capacity to accommodate future growth and mitigate risk of rate limiting.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
  - Patch GitHub API integration to implement efficient request caching.
  - Enhance logging and monitoring to track API usage patterns and identify potential rate-limiting issues early.
  - Conduct thorough load testing to simulate various user scenarios and validate the effectiveness of implemented solutions.
  - Document best practices for API usage and rate-limiting mitigation strategies for future reference.

This postmortem highlights the critical steps taken to address the outage caused by GitHub API rate limiting. By implementing proactive monitoring, improving error handling, and optimizing API usage, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure a seamless user experience.
